Odstavec Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## About me

I graduated in Chemical Engineering, but I truly found my passion in working with data. Primarily creating small applications that are helpful for colleagues in manufacturing. I am employed as a Process Engineer at Gumokov a.s., where I work mainly with manufacturing and technological data. I frequently collaborate with the production planning department and the technological preparation of production. The majority of my work involves creating applications and automatically updated dashboards in Power BI. Most of the data I work with comes from the SAP ERP system and internal databases, which I also help develop.

I have been responsible for projects such as:
- Polyvalence system
- Manufacturing capacity reporting system
- Automated production boards
- Release orders overviews
- Planning two-operator products on machines
- Raw materials, semi-finished products, and other inventory overviews
- Multi-level bill of materials breakdowns
- Work activity reports for various departments

I aspire to further develop my career in the field of **data analysis and programming**, focusing on **Python** and its applications in creating analytical tools and applications. My goal is to combine technical skills with creativity to develop solutions that drive decision-making and efficiency. I am currently enhancing my knowledge through various courses (including an eight-month Data Scientist course by CodersLab).
